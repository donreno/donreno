### HI! My name is [Renato San Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renato-san-martin-37306017/)
I'm a software engineer currently working at Falabella Financiero, Santiago, Chile.

## A bit about me 🤓
- Software engineer with more than 10 years of experience mostly coding 👴
- Trying to promote good practices, clean coding, TDD and love for the work on teams I work with in order to ensure good crafting 🍺 
- Agilesome practicioner 🐌
- Awesome team player (or at least that's what I think of myself) 🍻
- Always trying to share knowledge (and gain more while doing so) 🧙🏼‍♂️
- Most of my career I have been working as Java developer ☕
- Love my work (specially if AC's are clear) ✔️
- Fun fact: I hate moths (actually they scare me more than a giant spider) 😱

## What I'm currently doing 💻
- Mostly working Backend integrations with legacy apps (soap, sockets, etc..) to expose/integrate with different and more current protocols (http/rest, kafka, grpc, etc...).
- Building toolkits, templates and libraries to make other developers life easier (actually it is so my future self saves some time as well). 
- Mostly coding and learning with [golang](https://golang.org/)  (and I love it ❤️)
- Mentoring and promoting good practices and love for the work (as always).

## Languages and tools (top of mind) 🔨
- Java/Groovy: Spring framework, spring boot, Java EE, etc... (high exp)
- Javascript: nodejs, express, old good dom and web frameworks, etc... (mid exp)
- Golang: go-kit, sarama, etc... (mid exp)
- Kafka (mid exp)
- Shell (low/mid exp) 
- Kubernetes (low/mid exp)
- PCF (low exp)
- APIGee (low exp)
- C++ (low exp)


## What I'm looking forward 👁️
- Continue growing/learning/sharing  and crafting awesomeness materialized as beautiful functional software and tools.
- Improve my remote work and time management (thanks pandemics).
